# VSS CO  
**Innovating. Building. Shipping.**

VSS CO is a small development organization focused on building software that’s actually useful. We work across the web, backend systems, and interactive projects, and we care more about how things feel to use than how impressive they sound.

We ship early, iterate often, and don’t overthink things. Most projects start because something feels missing or annoying—and we’d rather build a solution than complain about it.

## What We Work On  

There isn’t a single category we stick to. We build what we’re interested in and what seems worth building.

That usually includes:

**Developer tools and libraries**  
Small, focused tools that remove friction and stay out of your way.

**Web systems**  
UI components, frontend utilities, backend services, and the glue that connects them.

**Games and interactive projects**  
Experiments around real-time logic, movement, networking, and systems that need to feel responsive.

**Open-source packages**  
Mostly in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, designed to be simple to adopt and easy to understand.

## Projects  

**Radium**  
A utility library built to be lightweight and expressive, without trying to do too much.

**ByteKV**  
A key–value storage system designed to be fast, clear, and boring in the best way possible.

**SuperMaze**  
A real-time maze game with a full client–server setup, built to explore movement, synchronization, and WebSockets.

## How We Think About Building  

We don’t have a long list of rules, but a few things matter:

- Code should be readable first  
- APIs should make sense without a guide  
- Developer experience is part of the product  
- Shipping something imperfect beats never shipping at all  

Open source isn’t a marketing choice for us—it’s just how we prefer to work.

## Why VSS CO Exists  

To build tools that feel good to use and don’t get in the way.  
To learn by building real things.  
And to share the results with anyone who finds them useful.
