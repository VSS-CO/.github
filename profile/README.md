### about

We build low-level tooling that helps distributed systems maintain state consistency. Our goal is to replace fragile glue code with typed, deterministic infrastructure.

Everything here is open source or source-available. We run on what we build.

### philosophy

* **No magic.** If it breaks, you should know exactly why.
* **Zero dependencies.** We prefer vendoring over vaguely versioned chains.
* **Local-first.** If it doesn't run on `localhost`, it doesn't go to prod.

### contributing

PRs are welcome on all public repos. Please check the `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the specific repository before opening a PR. We use Linear for tracking, but GitHub Issues are fine for bug reports.

### security
